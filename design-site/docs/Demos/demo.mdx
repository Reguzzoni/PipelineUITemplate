## Testing library modifications

To test any modifications you wish to make to the library, you must delete the demo's node-modules folder and re-install. Alternatively, you can replace the demo's package.json tgz pipeline-ui path with "file:../" and update the version code in the pipeline-ui package.json.

:::tip

To view changes to the library in your own project, add the dependency (with latest version number) "pipeline-ui": "file:./pipeline-ui-0.1.6.tgz" to its package.json file, and copy the tgz file to your project root directory.
