# Overview

The TEAL Contract Lab is an online tool to experiment with deploying and using TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Lanuage) smart contracts. 

## Get started

- • Select your net (for security reasons, the demo only allows the selection of testnet. You can enable mainnet by forking our github repository and adding MainNet to the network `<Select>` element)

- • Navigate to your MyAlgo wallet and set your wallet to testnet using their dropdown menu.

- • Fund your wallet via the link provided in the Demo

- • Select a TEAL contract using demo's the dropdown menus. 

:::tip

The demo's `log` window will only log select messages. We recommend that at this point the user open their browser console log by right-clicking on the screen, hitting `inspect` and selecting the `console` option.

:::

- • For the provided TEAL contracts, clicking `Deploy TEAL Contract` will deploy the smart contract with hard-coded global/local bytes/integers and the following initial appArgs: 

```jsx
let registrationStart = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound)
let registrationEnd = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound + 1000)
let voteStart = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound)
let voteEnd = algosdk.encodeUint64(params.firstRound + 1000)
```

- • Custom TEAL contracts will also be only deployed, but `appArgs`, byte slices and local/global integers can be fully customized. Appargs are entered as an array of strings `["",""]` and formated behind the scenes by the Demo's code. 

## Permissionless Voting

Selecting `Permissionless Voting` will display an interact module.

- • To run the poll, 2 or more users load the demo on seperate machines and connect their seperate accounts. The user who will deploy the contract selects `Permissionless Voting` and clicks `Deploy TEAL`.

- • Immediately after deploying the contract, the deployer must share the app id with voters.

- • Voters input the app id, selects a candidate and click `Vote`.

- • To view the votes progress, both deployer and voters can then click `refresh` which will trigger automated checking and visualization of vote tallies via the Alogrand indexer.

## Permissioned Voting

Selecting `Permissioned Voting` will also display an interact module with an additional input field for an `asset id`.

- • To run the poll, 2 or more users load the demo on seperate machines and connect their seperate accounts. The user who will deploy the contract selects `Permissionled Voting` and clicks `Deploy TEAL`, which will trigger the creation of an ASA (Algorand standard asset) with 10 voting tokens. After the creation of the tokens, another MyAlgo window will pop up requesting the deployer to create the app. 

- • Immediately after deploying the contract, the deployer must share the app id and token id with voters. 

- • After adding the token via myAlgo Wallet and recieving a token from the deployer, voters input the app id and asset id into their interact module, select candidates and click `Vote`.

- • To view the votes progress, both deployer and voters can then click `refresh` which will trigger automated checking and visualization of vote tallies via the Alogrand indexer.

## Frontend implementation

:::tip

We are working to port our React smart contract code to vanilla JavaScript. Currently, only some frontend functions are provided in the `Permissionless Voting` frontend codeblock. Stay tuned for a full port to the Pipeline Class!

:::

- • To utilize the frontend functions, simply set `teal` and `teal2` to actual teal program and clear program values as strings
