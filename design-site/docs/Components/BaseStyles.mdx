# BaseStyles

In order to set basic color, font-sizes, font-family, line-heights, style resets via normalize across your project, you will need to establish Pipeline's base styles for your app by wrapping all of your components in `<BaseStyles>`: 

```jsx
import {BaseStyles, Box, Heading} from 'pipeline-ui'
const App = (props) => {
  return (
  <BaseStyles>
      <Box m={4}>
        <Heading mb={2}>Hello, world!</Heading>
        <p>These elements will have Pipeline's base styles applied to them.</p>
      </Box>
    </BaseStyles>
  )
}
```
