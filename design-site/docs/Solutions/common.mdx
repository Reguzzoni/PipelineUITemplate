## How do I make a blank React app?

In command prompt, enter:

```bash
npx create-react-app myApp
```
Running this command generates a new folder called "myApp" (or whichever custom name you specify). Inside this folder you will find several pre-configured files. The primary file that you will be working with is App.js that is found in the src folder.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

<img alt="Docusaurus with Keytar" width="100%" height="400px" src={useBaseUrl('/img/pipeline_vectilla_5.svg')} />

## setState or this is not defined

:::tip

Make sure that your app is written as a class rather than as a function if you are using the `context` and `returnTo` props (used by `AlgoButton` and `AlgoSendButton`). If you want to write your app as a function, used the `onChange` prop instead, along with a callback/handler function.

Your code in App.js should look like this (when writing a React app as a class):

```jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class App extends Component{
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            myValue: "", //your values go here

        };
    }

    //your function and lifecycle code goes here

    render(){
        return ( //your jsx code goes between the <div> tags below:
            <div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default App;
```

## How to trigger other actions after connecting to MyAlgo or sending a transaction

Add the following code just above the `render()` call:

```jsx
 componentDidUpdate(_prevProps, prevState) {
    if (prevState.address !== this.state.address){ // note: address can be replaced with any state key
        //do something
    }
 }
 ```
In order to avoid an inifinite loop and browser crashing, setState (or functions that setState) should only be called in `componentDidUpdate` in a conditional block.
